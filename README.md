# Aviation Analysis :airplane:
In this project I use various big data tools like hadoop, Spark and Cassandra for analysis and storing of data to answer a particular set of day to day questions in Aviation operations such as:
* the best flight on a given day
* the most popular airports
* the most on-time airlines, etc. 

## Technologies and implementation
1. Data Extraction and Cleaning - Extracting csv files to HDFS
1. Data Analysis using Hadoop and PySpark
1. MapReduce codes in java
1. Process Mapreduce operation using Pyspark
1. Store mapreduce outputs in a dataframe into a cassandra table to retrieve our required results.

*I ran cassandra locally as the size of my datasets and scope of my project was quite small*
